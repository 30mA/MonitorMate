Relay Scripts
=============

I now believe this PHP script is as good if not better than the earlier python scripts. They do not include all the same features but it does the job in a much more simplistic fashion and is easier to maintain.

Right now this depends on having inverters, charge controlers, AND a FlexNet DC. I have at least one of each of these components and it's very difficult to design/develop it to work without a real-world configuration to test against.
